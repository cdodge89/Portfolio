# Portfolio

## Plans

###### About
  
- Picture, basic family info, hobbies, interests, How I came to love coding, etc
  
###### Resume
  
- Interactive Resume, where you click on a section, it expands with the info 
- hovering over a description gives a larger description
  
###### Portfolio
  
- Scrolling Tiles that show the name and a screen shot from each of my projects. 
- Each project is live, and has a link to git hub. 
- It would also be cool to embed the gist and have tabs for the different files
    
###### Contact
  
- contains basic contact info such as telephone and email
- or a form that sends me an email or a text (or both)
